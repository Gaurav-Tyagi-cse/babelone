                            coordinate our designs precisely with the original steel layout, which had unique dimensions
                            and configurations not fully documented. This required accurate alignment and careful
                            planning to ensure the new steel framing would seamlessly connect with and support the
                            existing framework.

                            and detailed field measurements. Using this data, we created an integrated 3D model that
                            combined both the existing and new steel structures. This model helped us identify potential
                            clashes, load concerns, and precise connection points before fabrication. We held frequent
                            coordination sessions with on-site engineers, incorporating real-time feedback to adjust
                            details as needed, ensuring that each new connection was compatible and structurally sound.
